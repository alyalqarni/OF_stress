# OF_stress

 decided to make this interaction relevant to a personal experience, whenever I struggle writing a code or an essay (both are not my favorite!) I keep pressing the keyboard randomly to release my frustration and then delete it and continue.

After working on the dog class example I decided to make the shapes interact with my frustration that I express by hitting these letters randomly.
